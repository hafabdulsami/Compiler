## Basic Lexer and Parser for a Simple Language

This project is part of my studies in Compiler Construction at the University of Engineering and Technology (UET), where I am learning the theory from Sir Talha Waheed and attending the lab sessions under Sir Laeeq Khan. This project demonstrates my understanding of the lexer and parser concepts, which are fundamental to compiler construction.

## Project Overview

The project implements a lexer and parser for a simplified programming language that supports:

- Variable declarations using `int`
- Arithmetic expressions (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Conditional statements (`if-else`)
- Comparison operations (`>`)
- Return statements
- Block parsing with `{}`

### Lexer

The lexer breaks the source code into a list of tokens. Each token represents a meaningful unit of the language, such as keywords (`int`, `if`, `else`, `return`), operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), and identifiers (variable names). It processes the input character by character and generates tokens based on language rules.

### Parser

The parser takes the tokens generated by the lexer and checks them against the languageâ€™s grammar. It ensures the input follows the correct structure and detects syntax errors. If the input is valid, it parses the program successfully.

## Supported Features

- Integer variable declarations (e.g., `int a;`)
- Arithmetic expressions with basic operators
- Conditional branching (`if` and `else`)
- Return statements (e.g., `return b;`)
- Expression evaluation (e.g., `b = a + 10;`)
- Block parsing with `{}`

## Project Structure

- `Compiler.cpp`: Contains both the lexer and parser implementation, along with the main function that executes the code.

## How to Run

Compile the code using a C++ compiler such as `g++`:

```bash
g++ Compiler.cpp -o compiler
```

Run the compiled program:

```bash
./compiler
```

The program uses a predefined code snippet in the input string within the main function:

```cpp
string input = R"(
int a;
a = 5;
int b;
b = a + 10;
if (b > 10) {
    return b;
} else {
    return 0;
}
)";
```

If the parsing completes successfully, you will see the message:

```
Parsing completed successfully! No Syntax Error
```

### Example

For the input code:

```cpp
int a;
a = 5;
int b;
b = a + 10;
if (b > 10) {
    return b;
} else {
    return 0;
}
```

The lexer generates tokens for each keyword, operator, and identifier. The parser then processes these tokens, ensuring the syntax is valid.

### Modifying the Input

To test different programs, modify the input string in the main function. You can write code in the supported syntax (variable declarations, arithmetic expressions, if-else statements, etc.).

## Future Enhancements

Some ideas for further development:

- Support for additional data types (e.g., `float`, `char`)
- More operators and comparisons (e.g., `<=`, `>=`, `==`)
- Semantic analysis (e.g., type checking, scope handling)
- Error recovery mechanisms

## Conclusion

This project provides a foundational understanding of how lexers and parsers function within a compiler. It showcases my progress in the Compiler Construction course and serves as a base for future projects involving more advanced compiler features.
